## A Better Way to Fund COVID-19 Research

The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to incredible innovation across every level of life: parents are now teachers, friends are now zoom-buddies, and working is incredibly remote.
Innovation has also happened in the science and research on COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.

While hard to believe, it's only been a few short months since the SARS-CoV-2 virus stepped onto the world stage.
In that time, researchers from all strands of viral, public health, and epidemiological science have had to rapidly pivot to the rising challenge.
Overall, this has been done admirably - we've never before had so much information, so quickly, this early in a global outbreak.

### The Problem

However hardworking scientists and researchers may be however, science does not run without funding.
Reagents & equipment are serious expenses, and often funds are ringfenced - you cannot simply spend money allocated to one project on another - even if there's a global pandemic going on.
Similarly, all the reagents and equiptment in the world is useless if you cannot pay for someone to run it. 

Funding agencies have put together emergency calls which aim to provide funds for research on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.
However, most funding bodies have themselves struggled to pivot very quickly to meet the different environment and circumstance we find ourselves in today.
For some, this was the first time they've had such an 'emergency' funding call - that in itself was an achievement.
This of course must be lauded, but for many labs, it's just not enough.

Applications are lengthy, outcomes uncertain, and the money comes slowly - all while scientists are working harder than every before.

### Two Solutions



**Let's try to find a better way. Let's enable great COVID-19 science.**

I want to help by:
- Donating funding to seed a [global SARS-CoV-2 sequencing fund](sequencing-fund.md).
- Donating to [fund a lab doing COVID-19 research](lab-funding.md)
