## A Better Way to Fund Science

The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to incredible innovation across every level of life: parents are now teachers, friends are now zoom-buddies, and working is incredibly remote.
Innovation has also happened in the science and research on COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.

While hard to believe, it's only been a few short months since the SARS-CoV-2 virus stepped onto the world stage.
In that time, researchers from all strands of viral, public health, and epidemiological science have had to rapidly pivot to the rising challenge.
Overall, this has been done admirably - we've never before had so much information, so quickly, this early in a global outbreak.

### The Problem

However hardworking scientists and researchers may be however, science does not run without funding.
Reagents & equipment are serious expenses, and often funds are ringfenced - you cannot simply spend money allocated to one project on another - even if there's a global pandemic going on.
Similarly, all the reagents and equiptment in the world is useless if you cannot pay for someone to run it. 

Funding agencies have put together emergency calls which aim to provide funds for research on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.
However, most funding bodies have themselves struggled to pivot very quickly to meet the different environment and circumstance we find ourselves in today.
For some, this was the first time they've had such an 'emergency' funding call - that in itself was an achievement.
This of course must be lauded, but for many labs, it's just not enough.

Applications are lengthy, outcomes uncertain, and the money comes slowly - all while scientists are working harder than every before.

#### Our current funding methods stand a good chance of failing COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 research.

Initiatives across the globe are setting up emergency #hCoV19 funding calls. 
They vary, but generally promise extra money into a cash-starved system (research).
Explicitly & implicitly this encourages *a lot* of scientists to switch to COVID-19 research - whether appropriate or not. Money is hard to come by in research. Every call - no matter how well or poorly suited - is potentially a few years' lifeline.
Diversity in applications is *good*! But funding at the best of times is *slow as mud.* Overload an emergency funding call - while all reviewers are distracted by a pandemic - & it ain't gonna go faster.
Every week feels like a year - what happens while we wait for funding?

Meanwhile, those working on COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 *right now* are those **least able** to write grants! 
Many of these scientists are working *unfunded* - putting their other work on hold, working without resources - to provide COVID-19 research *NOW*.
Many of these scientists *cannot write a grant*. 
Many of them are working all day, every day (including weekends). 
Grants usually take days - weeks - to prepare. 
That kind of time is absolutely laughable for COVID-19 researchers at the moment. 
The lucky among them find a few hours.

Those who don't have time to write at all *get* **nothing** & the work they do now is paid only in their sweat, tears & lost opportunities.
Those who scrape together a few hours compete against others who are not doing COVID-19 research now, who are operating more normally and could spend days on it.
These researchers at such a disadvantage are the ones who dropped everything to switch to this. 
They are glad to help. 
They work willingly. 
They are called by duty.
They are making your models, testing your patients, analysing your data, informing your govts - **right now**.

And the best outcome for them is a small chance of some money in a crowded field - in a few months. 
For others, who couldn't scrape together time to write a grant - nothing.
Regardless, they do and will keep going, setting aside all other opportunities & work.

#### Life isn't fair. But I, at least, cannot help but look at this & think *there must be a better way*.

More funding calls requiring different & long-form applications that take months to process *are not the answer*. 
Yet each agency in turn strolls out to lay them down.
Scientists despair with each because *there is no time* and yet what choice do we have but to *try* - because otherwise we struggle on unfunded.
So stay up late, work harder, tell them the research has to wait... in a pandemic. Is that what we want to encourage right now?

**We need a better way forward for COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 funding.**

One way might be to reward work **already done** - fast-track _short_ applications based on the incredible research done in the past 3 months to *continue this work*.
Scientists have never worked so hard, so openly, so urgently!
I know giving out money is fraught. 
Everyone wants results. 
Scientists do too! 
Perhaps a little more trust can be put into the scientists who have proven themselves in last 3 months?

Scientists are doing absolutely incredible things *with no funding for #COVID19 #SARSCoV2 at all.* 
Imagine what they could do if the pressures of applications & uncertainty about our futures were lifted!

**Let's try to find a better way. Let's enable great COVID-19 science.**
