# COVID-19 is global. Sequencing it should be too.

At Nextstrian, we depend on sequences generated by the hard work of labs around the world, who then share this data publicly on [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/).
The world has never seen so many sequences generated so quickly and shared so quickly in its history so far.
However, there are still so many places around the world for which we have no full-length, high quality sequencing

....

In partnership with Fred Hutch, we've created an initiative to get labs enough money to cover the cost of reagents & kit to run about ~100 samples over the next few months.
This is intended as 'bridge' funding to ensure sequences can be generated at this important time - during the growth and peak of the epidemic - while labs apply for grants.
