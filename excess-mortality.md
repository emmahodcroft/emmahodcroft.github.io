# Excess Mortality

I recently did a Twitter thread about 'excess mortality' and why it's a very useful quanitity to observe to better understand the impact of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.
You can read that thread [here](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1249996541424816128).
In short, 'excess mortality' means: How many more people died this year than died on average over the last few years?

This means we gather data on all deaths above what we expect - even if their official cause of death was not COVID-19.

I reached out to people on Twitter to try and gather links to country's data on excess mortality, if available.  Here's what I managed to gather!

## Netherlands
- Report from 10 April [here](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2020/15/mortality-rising-further) Appears it might be being updated. Link to datatable present.
- Another report from 9 Apr [here](https://www.rivm.nl/monitoring-sterftecijfers-nederland) Does not appear to be updated.

## Switzerland
- Updated data available [here](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/gesundheitszustand/sterblichkeit-todesursachen.html). Raw data available in middle of page.

## Spain
- Updated reports from Spain available [here](https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Servicios/VigilanciaSaludPublicaRENAVE/EnfermedadesTransmisibles/MoMo/Paginas/Informes-MoMo-2020.aspx) Click on the latest date. These are PDF - unsure if raw data availble somewhere.
